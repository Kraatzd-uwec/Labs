            <h2>What is a Blugold?</h2>
              
                <p>Throughout the history of the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, the question has been asked: What is a Blugold? Over the years, there has been much speculation on the origin of the Blugold. Research shows that the term simply evolved from the phrase “the Blue and Gold.” The first use of the term “Blugolds” that this researcher found occurred in a Spectator article in the fall of 1935. The Blugolds defeated Winona Teachers College football team and the writer shortened the combination of the school’s colors, blue and gold, into a single word.   The term “Blugold” stuck! <br> The Blugold is the esteemed mascot of UW-Eau Claire. While nobody there knows exactly what it is, it represents the symbol of excellence and is sometimes seen in the form of a person dressed as a blue and gold bird, giving out high fives at the bottom of the large hill in the middle of campus.</p>
